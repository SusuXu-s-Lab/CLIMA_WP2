"- Hurricane Ian Damage -I am needing a written approval for a temporary fence around my pool. Â While it is my understanding that temporary fencing is not required to be permitted, my HOA is telling me I have to remove the fence I put up. Â However it is state law that I have to have a temporary fence put up around my pool. Â I know there are statutes that govern permanent fencing around the pool with regards to materials, dimensions etc. but temporary fencing is a separate situation/governance. Â I prefer not to use the orange construction fencing as it is not rigid at the bottom and a neighbors kid can easily crawl under orange temporary fencing. I would like to use the aluminum black panel fencing you can buy at Lowe's that provides a safer and more rigid fencing until I can get my new pool cage installed. Â However, due to Hurricane Ian damage, the turn times on this is not super fast due to materials and labor holdups. Â If you can provide something to me in writing that says I can use this black fencing or that there are no laws governing temporary fencing and I am by default approved to use this fencing that would be great. Â This is the product I have installed as temporary fencing:Â https://www.lowes.com/pd/No-Dig-Actual-3-37-ft-x-4-12-ft-Grand-Empire-Powder-coated-Steel-Pressed-Point-Decorative-Metal-Fence-Panel/3028522I just don't want something that is flimsy such as the orange fencing provide ample opportunity for some kids to easily crawl under which is why I spent more for this more rigid fencing. Â I apologize I am not clear on what these mean below. Â I did read the links but didn't quite understand what they meant. Â So if I was supposed to check yes I apologize: Â Private Provider Plan Review?:	YesNo*Private Provider Inspections?:Yes/NoÂ Thank you so very much for your time and efforts in advance.Â Regards,Â Brad Weaver",Payment Required,0,ePlan,,-81.969995990904,26.510604006783,2023-06-01
