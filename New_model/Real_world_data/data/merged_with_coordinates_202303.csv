"Iâm attaching the Steel Certification for the metal deck component along with the invoice indicating the specific B Deep Panel 18 gauge.  Jim fastened with a #14 Steel Screw into every 6â low flute into each purlin for maximum design pressures.  The installation entailed replacing panels 20â in, across the back of the length of the building. There is no NOA for the panel, only the steel certification as Miami Dade Approved.  We have a GC ready to go so we just need the engineering calcs.  Please correct me if Iâm wrong but at this point an engineer needs to provide the signed calcs for this assembly to be approved by the permit office.  Once we have those calcâs back from your office, we would then be able to have our GC open a permit with an approved assembly with signed sealed engineering calcs.  We will of course be pulling our roofing permit so we can recreate attached to the GC permit.",Waiting on Applicant,0,ePlan,,-81.873504466636,26.578295716154,2023-03-01
