"FNC2023-01947","15827 CALOOSA CREEK CIR, FORT MYERS FL 33908","- Hurricane Ian Damage -I am needing a written approval for a temporary fence around my pool.  While it is my understanding that temporary fencing is not required to be permitted, my HOA is telling me I have to remove the fence I put up.  However it is state law that I have to have a temporary fence put up around my pool.  I know there are statutes that govern permanent fencing around the pool with regards to materials, dimensions etc. but temporary fencing is a separate situation/governance.  I prefer not to use the orange construction fencing as it is not rigid at the bottom and a neighbors kid can easily crawl under orange temporary fencing. I would like to use the aluminum black panel fencing you can buy at Lowe's that provides a safer and more rigid fencing until I can get my new pool cage installed.  However, due to Hurricane Ian damage, the turn times on this is not super fast due to materials and labor holdups.  If you can provide something to me in writing that says I can use this black fencing or that there are no laws governing temporary fencing and I am by default approved to use this fencing that would be great.  This is the product I have installed as temporary fencing: https://www.lowes.com/pd/No-Dig-Actual-3-37-ft-x-4-12-ft-Grand-Empire-Powder-coated-Steel-Pressed-Point-Decorative-Metal-Fence-Panel/3028522I just don't want something that is flimsy such as the orange fencing provide ample opportunity for some kids to easily crawl under which is why I spent more for this more rigid fencing.  I apologize I am not clear on what these mean below.  I did read the links but didn't quite understand what they meant.  So if I was supposed to check yes I apologize:  Private Provider Plan Review?:	YesNo*Private Provider Inspections?:Yes/No Thank you so very much for your time and efforts in advance. Regards, Brad Weaver","Payment Required","0","ePlan",
