The installation entailed replacing panels 20’ in, across the back of the length of the building. There is no NOA for the panel, only the steel certification as Miami Dade Approved.  We have a GC ready to go so we just need the engineering calcs.  Please correct me if I’m wrong but at this point an engineer needs to provide the signed calcs for this assembly to be approved by the permit office.  Once we have those calc’s back from your office, we would then be able to have our GC open a permit with an approved assembly with signed sealed engineering calcs.  We will of course be pulling our roofing permit so we can recreate attached to the GC permit.","Waiting on Applicant","0","ePlan",
