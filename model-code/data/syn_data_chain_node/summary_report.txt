CHAIN NETWORK TEST WITH REAL VARIABLE RECORDING
================================================================================

TEST SETUP:
- 5 households in chain structure: A(0)-B(1)-C(2)-D(3)-E(4)
- Sequential activation: A(t=1), B(t=2), C(t=3), D(t=4), E(t=5)
- Observed pairs: (0,1) and (2,3)
- Hidden pairs to infer: (1,2) and (3,4) should be bridging
- Only 'vacant' decision is active

TRAINING RESULTS:
- Initial ELBO: -7.066492
- Final ELBO: -7.035567
- Improvement: +0.030925

GENERATED FILES:
1. REAL TRAINING VARIABLES (MAIN OUTPUT):
   - real_training_variables.json (complete machine-readable data)
   - real_training_variables.txt (human-readable analysis)

2. SUPPORTING ANALYSIS:
   - summary_report.txt (this file)

WHAT THE REAL TRAINING VARIABLES CONTAIN:
For each recorded epoch and timestep:
1. Exact Gumbel-Softmax samples generated during training
2. Self-activation probabilities from neural networks
3. Neighbor influence probabilities from neural networks
4. Final FR-SIC probabilities: 1 - (1-p_self) * ‚àè(1-p_neighbor)
5. Only inactive nodes are included (only these need prediction)

KEY POINTS:
- All data comes directly from training process, no re-computation
- Variables are captured at the exact moment of computation
- Each sample shows the complete computation chain
- Averaged probabilities across samples are also provided
